Blue solid arrows denote recruitment. Black solid arrows denote progression of the disease. Red dashed arrows denote disease transmission. Purple solid arrows denote mortalities. Parameters are detailed in full in Table 2 where λ and λ are defined in Eq 2 (i) and (ii) respectively, and B(t) is defined in Eq 1.  \\n   [Link to figure](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0011543.g002)\\n\\n3. **Fig 3.** The epidemiological model captured 3 consecutive Lf epidemics in Nigeria. The simulated cases compared with the observed data. In orange is the 90% range of values I takes in the final generation at each time point; the median value in blue. Confirmed case data for Nigeria are in black. The model replicates the sharp increase in case incidences occurring at the start of the year for 3 years.  \\n   [Link to figure](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0011543.g003)\\n\\n4. **Fig 4.** The marginal posterior distributions of the final set of accepted particles from fitting. Fig 4 top left the shape parameter of the rodent recruitment function, s. Fig 4 top right the rodent-to-rodent transmission rate β. Fig 4 mid left the human-to-human transmission rate β. Fig 4 mid right the rodent-to-human transmission rate β. Fig 4 bottom left the date of minimum rat recruitment ϕ.  \\n   [Link to figure](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0011543.g004)\\n\\n5. **Fig 5.** Underlying vector dynamics reveal high-risk period of spill-over transmission for Nigerians. The figure showcases the evolution of M. natalensis compartments throughout the observed period, simulated using the parameters derived from the final generation of accepted values. The median value is represented by the dashed line, while the colored area illustrates the range. Susceptible rats are depicted in red, infected rats in green, and recovered rats in blue. Notably, the recruitment of susceptible rats progressively rises, providing impetus for the growth of infected rats, reaching its peak in late December.  \\n   [Link to figure](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0011543.g005)\\n\\n6. **Fig 6.** The range and median of the effective reproduction rate for rat-to-rat transmission Rrr(t) and when the threshold for Rrr(t) ≥ 1 is met. In Fig 6(a) Rrr(t), median dashed line and range in colored block, exhibits a sharp increase towards the end of the year, foreshadowing the subsequent outbreaks in the following months. To maintain clarity, the data is limited to the years 2019 and 2020, as complete earlier records are available. Fig 6(b) showcases a box diagram illustrating the time of year when Rrr(t) exceeds the threshold of 1, denoting high transmission. The bottom panel of Fig 6(b) captures the onset of the high transmission period, while the upper panel displays its conclusion. The intermediate phase witnesses a rapid shift in reservoir dynamics, leading to an escalation in the number of infected vectors.  \\n   [Link to figure](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0011543.g006)' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 803, 'prompt_tokens': 19351, 'total_tokens': 20154}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_483d39d857', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-e8e8968b-d942-4f59-be75-8ac2c66203f3-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 19351, 'output_tokens': 803, 'total_tokens': 20154}\n"

This indicates a significant rise in incidence, suggesting either an outbreak or improved reporting practices.\\n- **2020**: The cases surge dramatically in early 2020, peaking again above 80 cases per week, signifying another potential outbreak or epidemic wave, likely with enhanced surveillance or a real increase in infection rates.\\n\\n### 2. **Peak Incidence**\\n- **Definition**: The highest number of cases reported in any single week during the observation period.\\n- In **2018**, the peak was around 20 cases, occurring within a few weeks.\\n- In **2019**, the highest peak reached approximately 75 cases, indicating a dramatic escalation in the incidence.\\n- In **2020**, there was a further increase, reaching over 80 cases, highlighting a crucial point of outbreak that warrants public health attention.\\n\\n### 3. **Epidemic Wave Patterns**\\n- **2018-2019**: The pattern shows irregular, albeit low, frequency with a few peaks. The curves suggest sporadic outbreaks without a clear seasonality.\\n- **2019-2020**: A more pronounced wave pattern emerges, indicating recurrent outbreaks. The regular spikes in weekly cases imply that Lassa fever might have seasonal trends or epidemic cycles.\\n\\n### 4. **Duration of Outbreaks**\\n- Observing the duration of increased case counts is crucial. Each spike during 2019 and 2020 lasts several weeks, indicating sustained transmission periods.\\n- Particularly in early **2020**, the duration of high cases extended, suggesting a prolonged outbreak which could strain healthcare resources.\\n\\n### 5. **Trends Over Time**\\n- Throughout the years, a gradual increase in the magnitude of incidence is evident. Early years show lower total counts compared to subsequent years, revealing a potential rise in either infectious rates or improved diagnostic and reporting capacities.\\n- The year **2020** reveals a notable urgency as cases seem to escalate rapidly, potentially indicating a need for focused interventions.\\n\\n### 6. **Inter-Year Comparisons**\\n- **Comparative Analysis**: There’s a noticeable increase in case numbers every following year, highlighting either environmental, social, or healthcare system changes contributing to susceptibility or connectivity among populations.\\n- **Public Health Implications**: A rise in confirmed cases over the years reiterates the need for continuous public health efforts, monitoring, and response strategies to mitigate Lassa fever's impact.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe graph clearly illustrates significant increases in weekly confirmed cases of Lassa fever from 2018 to 2020, along with notable seasonal and epidemic characteristics.

Here’s a detailed explanation of each parameter.\\n\\n### 1. **s (Susceptible Population)**\\n- **Description**: This parameter represents the susceptible individuals in the population who can contract Lf.\\n- **Change in Value**: In the histogram, we see a left-skewed distribution with a gradually decreasing value, indicating that as time progresses, the number of susceptible individuals decreases due to either infection or recovery. The peak around the middle suggests a significant population that is still susceptible at the mid-point of the observed period. The red curve may represent the theoretical expected decline over time, showing the potential impact of other factors, such as vaccination or treatment.\\n\\n### 2. **βhh (Infection Rate from Human to Human)**\\n- **Description**: This parameter quantifies the transmission rate of Lf between infected and susceptible individuals in the human population.\\n- **Change in Value**: The histogram shows a bimodal distribution indicating varying rates of transmission during the epidemic periods. The peak around 2 suggests that transmission is quite efficient during certain periods. The variation implies that factors such as behavior or environmental conditions might influence transmission dynamics.\\n\\n### 3. **βrr (Infection Rate from Reservoir to Reservoir)**\\n- **Description**: This parameter looks at the transmission rate between infected and susceptible reservoirs (e.g., mosquitos).\\n- **Change in Value**: The graph indicates a distribution with a mode around 1, suggesting a moderate transmission rate. The decline in the tail reflects fewer scenarios with high transmission rates. This parameter being less than βhh suggests that transmission through human reservoirs is often more effective.\\n\\n### 4. **βrh (Infection Rate from Reservoir to Human)**\\n- **Description**: This parameter assesses the transmission of infection from mosquitos to humans.\\n- **Change in Value**: The range of values clusters around 34-36, indicating that the transmission from reservoir to humans is steady. The relatively stable distribution suggests that environmental conditions allow a consistent rate of transmission from the mosquito population.\\n\\n### 5. **φ (Recovery/Progression Rate)**\\n- **Description**: This metric usually represents the rate of recovery or progression from the infected state.\\n- **Change in Value**: The histogram shows a peak around 0.1, suggesting that recovery or progression rates vary, with most individuals experiencing a moderate rate of recovery over time. The decline shows that fewer people progress towards severe infection states as time progresses.\\n\\n### 6. **Ir(0) (Initial Infected Population)** \\n- **Description**: This represents the initial number of infected individuals in the population at the start of the simulation.\\n- **Change in Value**: The values cluster around 0.15, indicating a stable number of initially infected individuals, which likely drives the simulation outputs. The variation here suggests that different initial conditions might have been considered in model runs, which could influence future case incidence patterns.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nOverall, these parameters contribute to the model's ability to simulate observed cases of Lf in Nigeria. The sharp increases in incidence observed at the start of the year for three consecutive years highlight the seasonal aspects of transmission and the cumulative effects of these parameters. The model's alignment with observed data suggests it effectively captures the complexities of Lf dynamics in Nigeria, influenced by a mix of socio-economic and environmental factors.

In the figure, sharp peaks may indicate higher recruitment rates during specific periods. An increase in the shape parameter could lead to a steeper rise in rodent populations, shown by pronounced peaks on the graph, while lower values would indicate a gradual incline.\\n\\n2. **Rodent-to-Rodent Transmission Rate (β)**:\\n   - This value indicates how effectively the disease spreads among rodents. A higher β would correlate with rapid spikes in rodent infection numbers during specific time points. From observing the fluctuations, during early 2019 and mid-2020 there are significant peaks which might suggest increased transmission rates at those times. Conversely, a low β might lead to slower increases in infection rates or gradual declines.\\n\\n3. **Human-to-Human Transmission Rate (β)**: \\n   - Similar to the rodent transmission, this parameter estimates how diseases spread between humans. The pattern in the figure likely reflects periods where potential rodent diseases had more significant human interaction, potentially causing spikes in human infection rates. A considerable spike during mid-2019 could indicate increased human transmission correlating with rodent populations that surged at the same time.\\n\\n4. **Rodent-to-Human Transmission Rate (β)**:\\n   - This parameter measures how often rodents transmit diseases to humans. The figure suggests periods of peak rodent populations aligning with higher infection counts in humans. The spikes in rodent populations might have increased opportunities for transmission, justifying higher β values in those periods.\\n\\n5. **Date of Minimum Rat Recruitment (ϕ)**:\\n   - This parameter indicates when rat populations are lowest. The graphical data portrays troughs indicative of lower rodent populations. Tracking the minimum points visually in the graph can help estimate specific periods when rodent recruitment is at its nadir, which is critical for understanding potential lags in disease transmission pathways.\\n\\n### Summary of Changes:\\n- The **marginal posterior distributions** suggest variability in each of these parameters over time and how they interrelate with peaks and troughs seen in the graph.\\n- Notably, the **peaks and troughs** in rodent populations influence transmission dynamics, demonstrating an intricate interplay between rodent recruitment rates and disease spread among both rodent and human populations.\\n- The **tightness and width of the credible intervals** in the figure imply how confident researchers are about the estimated parameters; narrower intervals can indicate more certainty about the transmission rates, whereas wider intervals suggest variability and uncertainty.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the figure effectively encapsulates the dynamics of rodent population recruitment and the subsequent effects on disease transmission through careful observations of epidemiological parameters over time.

When \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\) is above 1, it suggests an outbreak, as each infected rat is likely to infect more than one other rat.\\n\\n2. **Median Lines and Credible Intervals**:\\n    - The **median dashed lines** represent the central tendency of \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\) for each year (2019 and 2020). \\n    - The **90% credible intervals** (colored shaded areas) encapsulate the range of uncertainty around these median estimates. They provide insight into how the variation around the median influences outbreak risk; wider intervals indicate greater uncertainty in the estimation.\\n\\n3. **Trends Over Time**:\\n    - The figure shows a **sharp increase towards the end of the year**, particularly evident in the 51st week (~December), indicating a surge in transmission just before the potential for outbreaks in subsequent months.\\n    - **For 2019**, there appears to be a higher peak than for 2020, suggesting that conditions (e.g., population density, environmental factors) may have differed to result in a greater effective transmission rate that year.\\n\\n4. **Interpretation of Peaks**:\\n    - The peak in \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\) at the end of the year foreshadows outbreaks, suggesting that if the trend continues, there is a heightened risk for the months following, due to a larger susceptible rat population and possibly insufficient control measures.\\n\\n### Fig 6(b): Box Plot of the Effective Reproduction Rate\\n\\n1. **Box Diagram Overview**:\\n    - The box plot provides a visualization of when \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\) exceeds the critical threshold of 1. This occurs during specific periods which indicate times of high transmission risk.\\n\\n2. **Start and End of High Transmission**:\\n    - The plot distinctly marks **the start** of the high transmission period around early November and shows an **end** by mid-January. \\n    - The comparative positions of the boxes for each period indicate the distribution of \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\) values, with wider boxes suggesting a larger spread of the reproduction rate during high-risk periods.\\n\\n3. **Dynamics During the Intermediate Phase**:\\n    - Between the start and the end of significant transmission, there’s a **rapid shift in the reservoir dynamics**. This term likely refers to changes in the population of infected rats and how they interact, possibly leading to an increase in infected vectors, such as parasites or diseases that spread through the rat population.\\n\\n4. **Conclusions Regarding Epidemiological Dynamics**:\\n    - The pattern observed indicates that there are identifiable windows in time where the potential for outbreaks is significantly enhanced, guided by the temporal dynamics of \\\\( R_{rr}(t) \\\\). Understanding these periods is crucial for designing targeted interventions to control rat populations and mitigate future outbreaks.\\n\\n### Summary\\nIn conclusion, Fig 6(a) highlights an alarming increase in the effective reproduction rate at year-end, indicative of potential future transmission surges. Fig 6(b) maps out clear start and end dates for high-risk periods, allowing for strategic planning in controlling the epidemiological trends.
